# Cairo Metro Fastest Way

Welcome to Cairo Metro Fastest Way! This project is aimed at providing a simple solution for calculating the shortest route between Cairo Metro stations. Using React for the frontend, Node.js for authentication, and JavaScript for the algorithmic calculations, this project aims to make navigating the Cairo Metro system a breeze.

## Features

- **Shortest Route Calculation**: Utilizing a custom JavaScript algorithm, this project calculates the shortest route between two Cairo Metro stations.
- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login functionalities powered by Node.js ensure a safe user experience.
- **Interactive Metro Map**: The main component displays an interactive map of Cairo Metro stations, allowing users to easily select their starting and ending stations.

## Components

1. **Signup**: Allows new users to create an account securely.
2. **Login**: Enables registered users to log in and access the main functionality of the application.
3. **Metro**: The main component where users can view the metro map and input their start and end stations to find the fastest route.
